# StanfordCodeInPlace
A simple project I made for Stanford University's Code In Place programme, 2023.
This code creates a canvas, a 3x3 color palette, and hovering over with the mouse prints on the terminal the name of the color.
Useful and open to implementation for creating accessibility features for color blindness.

Code In Place is an online programming initiative by Stanford University. Over the weeks there have been sessions with lecturers
from Stanford University going over the course material of CS106A. We were assigned to leaders and had a live session each week, 
followed by assignments. My personal goals and outcomes were learning Python as well as working on code in a non-business setting.
We had the opportunity to create visual games and interactive code, which has been an area of programming I had not explored before.
